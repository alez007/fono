//!
//! **It goes through the production turn.** The utterance arrives as text, and
//! from there it is [`crate::assistant::run_assistant_turn`] and
//! [`crate::actions`] with nothing swapped out — the same prompt, the same room
//! hint, the same schema check, the same retry ladder, the same readback. A
//! harness that posted its own request to the model would grade the model;
//! this grades what the user will actually experience.
//!
//! **The fixtures name no device.** They state a requirement — "any light",
//! "a room with a light and something else switchable in it" — and it is
//! resolved against whatever house the suite is pointed at. That is what makes
//! them safe to commit, and it also makes them somebody else's benchmark: a
//! stranger clones the repo and runs it on their home with no configuration at
//! all. Results are split so the shareable half carries verdicts and timings
//! and never a device name; the half that names things stays on disk.
//!
//! Feature-gated and off by default, so the shipped binary carries none of it.
